# CS-2XA3
The task is to write a NASM program. The executable should be called sufsort
(short for suffixx sort). The program sufsort gets a string of length 1 to 30 as an
input via the command line argument, for instance executing sufsort abbacd will
\pass" to the program the string abbacd, while executing sufsort aabaabba will
\pass" to the program the string aabaabba. The string is to be stored in a byte
array terminated by 0 in the program's memory, then displayed on the screen, then its
suxes are sorted according to the lexicographical ordering and displayed on the screen
in the ascending manner. For denition of lexicographical ordering see for instance
